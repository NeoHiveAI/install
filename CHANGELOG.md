# Changelog

All notable changes to [NeoHive](https://neohive.ai) are published here.
The in-app update banner reads each version's `### Release overview`
block and links back to this file for the full notes; everything else
is reference material for users who want the details.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and
the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## v1.4.9 — 2026-05-14

### Release overview
Adds a `NEOHIVE_CHUNKER_TIMEOUT_MS` environment override so ingestion of
very large PDFs through the docling bridge no longer times out at the
default 30-second per-chunk budget. Forwarded to the container as
`MEMVEC_CHUNKER_TIMEOUT_MS`. A 900-page document typically needs ~20
minutes (`NEOHIVE_CHUNKER_TIMEOUT_MS=1200000`).

### Added
- `NEOHIVE_CHUNKER_TIMEOUT_MS` env override on the installer, validated
  as a positive integer and forwarded to the container

## v1.4.8 — 2026-04-23

### Release overview
Hotfix release: preflight NVIDIA Container Toolkit before pulling the
`:cuda` image so CUDA hosts without `nvidia-container-toolkit` get a
clear error instead of an opaque container start failure.

### Fixed
- `:cuda` install path now fails fast with an actionable message when
  the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is missing on the host

## v1.4.7 — 2026-04-22

### Release overview
Trust multi-arch manifest lists in tag resolution and filter pre-release
tags from the fallback chain so `latest` resolves cleanly on ARM hosts.

### Fixed
- Multi-arch manifest lists are now treated as valid by the tag resolver
- Pre-release tags (`-rc1`, `-beta`) no longer leak into the fallback chain

## v1.4.6 — 2026-04-20

### Release overview
Adds a deterministic image tag fallback chain with a dry-run harness so
backend mismatches degrade gracefully (e.g. CUDA → Vulkan → CPU) rather
than failing the install outright.

### Added
- Image tag fallback chain per backend
- `NEOHIVE_DRY_RUN=1` harness for testing fallback logic without
  touching `docker pull`
